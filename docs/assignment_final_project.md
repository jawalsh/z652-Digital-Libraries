# Final Project

## Purpose
You will build a digital collection with [CollectionBuilder][cb] to gain competence with CollectionBuilder and integrate and demonstrate knowledge and skills of digitization and metadata for digital collections.

## Scenario
You are the digital projects librarian at a small liberal arts college. The library is evaluating CollectionBuilder as a platform for showcasing digitized collections from the college’s libraries and special collections. You have been asked to created a prototype collection in CollectionBuilder to demonstrate and report on the framework’s capabilities.

## Description


### 1. CollectionBuilder site

Develop a prototype CollectionBuilder site that meets the following criteria:	
- Site includes 24 or more digitized items that conform digitized following relevant digitization standards and best practices;
- Each item includes all appropriate required and option CollectionBuilder metadata elements (see <https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/metadata/gh_metadata/>); 
- Metadata conforms to specifications outlined in the CollectionBuilder[cb] documentation and to previously established metadata guidelines for your project;
- Site ncludes one or more pages, in addition to the standard CollectionBuilder pages, that introduces the content and context of the collection. See <https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/pages/interpretive/> and <https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/pages/add_page/>;}

### 2. Evaluation memo

Based on your experience implementing this prototype collection, submit a short memo (no more than 2 single-spaced pages) to library administrators and senior IT staff advising them about the pros and cons of CollectionBuilder as a platform for showcasing your college’s digital collections and making a recommendation about whether to move forward with implementing CollectionBuilder for your college. See “[How to Write a Memo](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/how-to-write-memo/)” for some helpful guidance.

### 3. Video presentation

Submit a 5-7 minute video presentation of about your final project posted to the “Final Project Presentation” discussion. In your video presentation you should 
- provide a brief overview of the content, significance, and audience of your collection; 
- show one or more items from your collection and discuss the metadata, especially additional metadata fields (beyond the standard CollectionBuilder fields) that you used in your collection;
- demonstrate contextual pages and exhibits that you created
- demonstrate one or more advanced features that you implemented;  
- discuss any challenges, accomplishments, or discoveries that occurred during the development of your project.

**_Your presentation must not exceed 7 minutes._**
