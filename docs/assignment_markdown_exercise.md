# Markdown exercise

Consult the [markdown_exercise.pdf](https://github.com/jawalsh/z652-Digital-Libraries/raw/main/resources/markdown_exercise.pdf) and create a new markdown document formated more or less like the PDF file. 

The file [markdown_exercise.txt](https://github.com/jawalsh/z652-Digital-Libraries/blob/main/resources/markdown_exercise.txt) contains the plain text form the PDF file, so you don't have to re-type everything, just copy in the plain text and add the markdown code.
