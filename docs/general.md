# General Information

## Course Description<a id="desc"/>
In this course students learn to conceptualize, plan, and build digital libraries. In the process of doing that, we will learn about digitization of text and image documents, metadata, and various digital library-related technologies, standards, systems, and software.

## Course Goal
By the end of the semester students will will be able to digitize a collection of non-digital content (e.g., letters, pamphlets, photographs, audio tapes) and develop a digital library populated with the digitized content, associated metadata, and contextualizing information.

## Learning Outcomes
- Students will be able to select appropriate digitization standards and best practices for different media types and compose project-specific digitization guidelines for a specific collection.
- Students will be able to select appropriate metadata standards and best practices for different types of content and intellectual domains and compose project-specific metadata guidelines for a specific collection.
- Students be able to demonstrate expertise with the open source digital collections systems ([CollectionBuilder][cb], [Omeka][omekaorg]) by building a digital collection within one of these systems.
- Through written text and online exhibitions, students will be able to describe, introduce, and explain the significance of a collection.
- Students will be be able to perform a number of specific technical tasks related to digital collection development. For example, students will be able to:
	- apply XML schemas to create valid XML metadata files;
	- to apply XSLT style sheets to convert from one metadata format to another;
	- execute Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) commands to retrieve metadata records from OAI data providers;
	- perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on a set of image files.

## Sexual Harassment

As your instructor, one of my responsibilities is to create a positive learning environment for all students. Title IX and IU’s Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibit sexual misconduct in any form, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and dating and domestic violence. If you have experienced sexual misconduct, or know someone who has, the University can help.

If you are seeking help and would like to speak to someone confidentially, you can make an appointment with:

The Sexual Assault Crisis Services (SACS) at (812) 855-8900 (counseling services) Confidential Victim Advocates (CVA) at (812) 856-2469 (advocacy and advice services) IU Health Center at (812) 855-4011 (health and medical services)
It is also important that you know that Title IX and University policy require me to share any information brought to my attention about potential sexual misconduct, with the campus Deputy Title IX Coordinator or IU’s Title IX Coordinator. In that event, those individuals will work to ensure that appropriate measures are taken and resources are made available. Protecting student privacy is of utmost concern, and information will only be shared with those that need to know to ensure the University can respond and assist.

I encourage you to visit <http://stopsexualviolence.iu.edu/index.html> to learn more.
