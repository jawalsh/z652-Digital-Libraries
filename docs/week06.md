# Week 6: Metadata, Part 1

##Summary
We will learn about what metadata is, different types of metadata, what it's used for, and why it's important. We will also learn about a few different major metadata application profiles (also known as schemas) commonly used in digital libraries.

## Weekly Learning Objectives
- _define_ metadata
- _distinguish_ between types of metadata and metadata standards
- _design_ "functional requirements" to guide creating a metadata application profile
- _identify_ relevant Dublin Core elements for a given item
